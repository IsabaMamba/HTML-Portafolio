<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kristopher Isaba Jimenez, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. My passion for technology and problem-solving drives me to constantly learn and improve my skills in various programming languages and development frameworks. I am particularly interested in web development, where I enjoy creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in system design, coding, and project management, all of which I aim to leverage in my future career as a software engineer.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic and professional interests, I have a deep love for sports, particularly basketball. I spend a lot of my free time playing basketball, which not only keeps me physically fit but also sharpens my teamwork and strategic thinking skills. Additionally, I am passionate about staying healthy and regularly hit the gym to maintain a balanced lifestyle. These activities help me stay disciplined, focused, and energized, allowing me to approach both my studies and personal projects with full commitment.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, I am fortunate to share my life with my girlfriend, Roxana Rubi. She is an incredible source of support and inspiration for me, encouraging me to strive for my goals and dreams. We enjoy spending quality time together, whether it's exploring new places, trying out new hobbies, or simply relaxing at home. My relationship with Roxana adds a wonderful dimension to my life, giving me motivation and joy every day.</p>
